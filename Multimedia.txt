1. Audio
1.1 No sound in built-in hardware for the jack 3.5 mm   // Debian bug 856505, the driver has still not been added upstream.
1.2 Hdmi audio out
 If you have this, I think you should use it.
1.3 Webcam audio in
 If you have audio in your webcam, maybe you should try it
1.4 Usb audio in/out    // See photo of my audio device, 20180520_205531.jpg
 1.4.1 Plug in the usb audio device // I plugged in the audio device in Port 1 in the Usb hub.
 1.4.2 System Setting, I see PnP device as second and the first one is grey. Do not care, grey is grey.
 1.4.3 Audio Volume, Applications, Notifications Sounds, I increased
 1.4.4 Audio and Video, Test notifications. It worked before!

1.5 Usb audio in/out device:    // I have problem with my Raspberry PI 2 and 3.
 1.5.1 Phonon Juk=Frontend GStreamer=Backend
  I had my music library on Usb and to read from usb and play out to usb did not work with flac or ogg.
  To play from ogg music from sd card worked only in the beginning.
 1.5.2 Phonon Juk=Frontend VLC=Backend  // The GStreamer backend disappeared for me after an upgrade
  The audio did not work at all. 
 1.5.3 Phonon Elisa=Frontend Xine=Backend
  Is this a solution? Elisa is lightweight and should has potential. Is Xine lightweight? The Xine status is unclear and cannot be chosen for phonon today.
 1.5.4 Is Raspberry Pi 3B+ a solution?

2. Video
 Video out:
  ToDo: test a youtube video in Falkon browser.
 Video in, webcam:
  ToDo!
