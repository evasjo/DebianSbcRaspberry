PIM = Personal Information Manager

I need a) mail with pop3 b) contacts c) organizer with birthday and todo reminders (can be a separate app)

1. Kontact=Frontend Akonadi=Backend

I blocked akonadi-backend-mysql above, because it cannot downscale to 1 GB of total memory (year 2017).
I got "database reported transaction deadlock" with Sqlite3. I think the culprit was akonadi_indexing_agent (year 2017).
Kaddressbook crashed immediately on start "QSocketNotifier: Invalid socket 16 and type 'Read', disabling". The problem seemed to be in 32-bit environment. I had armhf (year 2017)

To use Sqlite3:
# nano -w /home/xxxxx/.config/akonadi/akonadiserverrc   // Change the "xxxxx" to your user name
 [%General]
 Driver=QSQLITE3
 [QSQLITE3]
 Name=/home/xxxxx/.local/share/akonadi/akonadi.db   // Change the "xxxxx" to your user name
