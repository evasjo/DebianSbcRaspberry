My old PC wac 286 times bigger than my Raspberry Pi 2.

2016-12-31, I made a decision to throw out a mountain of all old PC:s and parts (one exception, I kept an old PC if I should need a PC with CD reader).

Firstly, I am not responsble for you, your data or hardware or any.
You need at least 3 out of 5 of a scale of IT skills.

The aim for this guide is "Migration of from your old PC to SBC".

You will get a rock solid or state of the art system, depending on your release choice in Debian.

The migration will be done via PreSystem to MainSystem.
