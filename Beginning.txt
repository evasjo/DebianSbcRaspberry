Debian release:
I have chosen Debian release "sid". The release choice is "stable", "testing" or "unstable", or the codename for them. See https://www.debian.org/releases/  . If you want another release choice than "sid", read comments carefully below during installation and change from "sid" to your choice.

Debian flavour:
I have chosen Debian flavour "arm64". With SoC BCM2837, you can choose between "arm64" and "armhf". If you want "armhf", read comments carefully below during installation and change from "arm64".
With SoC BCM2836, you have to choose "armhf".

Debian kernel:
The Debian kernels used below are linux-image-arm64 or linux-image-armmp.
If you want to test linux-image-armmp-lpae or a specific version of armmp-lpae, be aware of Debian bug 884601. The last version of linux-image-armmp-lpae which worked was 4.13 according to Debian bug 884601.

Sd card knowledge:
Do not take out the sd card while the SBC is on.
Avoid if possible to switch off the electricty to the SBC while the SBC is running.
If the Gui is locked, try Ctrl+Alt+F2 login as root and "shutdown -r now" to restart.
